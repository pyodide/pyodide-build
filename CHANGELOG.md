# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

- Fixed a regression in quoting of pip arguments introduced in
  [#185](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/pull/185).
  [#209](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/pull/209)

## [0.30.4] - 2025/05/20

- Fixed compatibility with `virtualenv` 20.31 and later. The Pyodide virtual environment via `pyodide venv` no longer seeds
  `wheel`, i.e., the `--wheel`/`--no-wheel` options are not available anymore.
  [#208](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/pull/208)

- The default cross-build metadata URL was changed to https://pyodide.github.io/pyodide/api/pyodide-cross-build-environments.json to
  circumvent rate limits imposed by GitHub. It remains overridable by setting the `PYODIDE_CROSS_BUILD_ENV_METADATA_URL` environment variable.
  [#206](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/pull/206)

## [0.30.3] - 2025/05/17

- Added `interpreter` and `pacakge_index` to the variables available via `pyodide config get`.
  [#199](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/pull/199)

## [0.30.2] - 2025/05/05

- Fixed a regression in `pyodide venv` installation of shell entryppints introduced in
  [#185](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/pull/185)
  [#197](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/pull/197)

## [0.30.1] - 2025/04/25

### Added

- `pyodide config` exposes new variables: `pyodide_root`, `pyodide_abi_version`, and `python_include_dir`,
  and `ignored_build_requirements`.
  [#186](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/pull/186) and [#187](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/pull/187)

### Fixed

- `pyodide venv` now works in uv-managed environments.
  See [issue #143](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/issues/143).
  [#185](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/pull/185)

## [0.30.0] - 2025/04/08

### Added

- Added basic support for uv. `uv tool install pyodide-cli --with pyodide-build`, or
  `uvx --from pyodide-cli --with pyodide-build pyodide --help`, or using `pyodide-build`
  in `uv`-managed virtual environments will now work.
  [#132](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/pull/132)

- `pyodide build` now takes an additional `--xbuildenv-path` argument and corresponding
  equivalent `PYODIDE_XBUILDENV_PATH` environment variable to either use an existing
  cross-build environment or create one at the specified path. This means that users
  can use `pyodide xbuildenv install <...> --path` to install a cross-build environment
  somewhere and reuse this with `pyodide build`.
  [#158](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/pull/158)

- Added a new config variable `xbuildenv_path` that can be left in the `[tool.pyodide.build]`
  section in `pyproject.toml` and retrieved through `pyodide config get xbuildenv_path`.
  The `pyodide xbuildenv` and `pyodide build` commands will setup/use cross-build environments
  at this path if one isn't specified as a CLI argument or unless overridden through the
  `PYODIDE_XBUILDENV_PATH` environment variable.
  [#158](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/pull/158)

- Added support for building without a wheel without build isolation: `pyodide build` no accepts
  the `--no-isolation`/`-n` and/or `--skip-dependency-check`/`-x` flags to customise the wheel
  building behaviour, similar to `pypa/build`.
  [#152](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/pull/152)

### Changed

- The Rust toolchain version has been updated to `nightly-2025-01-18`.
  [#103](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/pull/103)

- Pyodide cross-build environments will now be installed in the user cache directory by default,
  which is `<home>/.cache` or XDG cache in Linux systems, and `/Users/<user>/Library/Caches` in macOS.
  [#148](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/pull/148)

- Removed `cmake` dependency from the package.
  The Pyodide build system now uses the `cmake` package specified in the `pyproject.toml` file
  of the target package.
  [#141](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/pull/141)

### Fixed

- Fixed Pyodide venv `sys_platform` marker evaluation with pip >= 25.
  [#108](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/pull/108)

## [0.29.3] - 2025/02/04

### Added

- Added new configuration variable `default_cross_build_env_url`.
  [#85](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/pull/85)

- Added a new recipe key `requirement.constraint` to set the package-level constraints.
  [#97](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/pull/97)

- The `pyodide venv` command now supports more `virtualenv` command-line flags
  to customise the virtual environment creation behaviour (experimental)
  [#117](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/pull/117)

## [0.29.2] - 2024/11/29

### Fixed

  This bug was introduced in version 0.28.
  [#67](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/pull/67)

## [0.29.1] - 2024/11/27

### Added

- Add `skip_emscripten_version_check` flag and SKIP_EMSCRIPTEN_VERSION_CHECK environment
  variable to skip emscripten version check.
  [#53](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/pull/53)
- Set the `EM_PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable used by emscripten/`pkg-config` to discover dependencies
  [#52](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/pull/52)

### Changed

- Source tar files are now extracted with python's [data filter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile.data_filter)
  [#52](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/pull/52)

- The `pyodide build` command will now raise an error if the local Python version has been changed,
  after the cross-build environment has been set up.
  [#62](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/pull/62)

## [0.29.0] - 2024/09/19

### Added

- The `pyodide xbuildenv search` command now accepts a `--json` flag to output the
  search results in JSON format that is machine-readable. The design for the regular
  tabular output has been improved.
  [#28](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/pull/28)

### Changed

- The `pyodide skeleton pypi --update` command and the `--update-patched` variant now
  validate the version and the source checksum when updating a package's recipe.
  [#27](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/pull/27)

- `pyo3_config_file` is no longer available in `pyodide config` command.
  Pyodide now sets `PYO3_CROSS_PYTHON_VERSION`, `PYO3_CROSS_LIB_DIR` to specify the cross compilation environment
  for PyO3.
